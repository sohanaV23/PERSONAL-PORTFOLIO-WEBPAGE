## **INTRODUCTION**

The Personal Portfolio Website is a front-end web application built to represent my technical skills, academic background, and projects as a Computer Science and Data Science student. The primary goal of this project is to provide an interactive and visually appealing digital resume that helps visitors learn more about me, my work, and how to contact me.

Created using core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this portfolio offers a responsive design that works seamlessly across different devices. It also includes modern features like dark mode, project cards, skill progress bars, and a contact form.
